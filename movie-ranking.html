 <h3>The Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King</h3><p>

The Lord of the Rings series is one of the few book to movie transitions that went well, especially when comparing the movies to other books to movies such as Eragon or the Chronicles of Narnia. It is also one of the series I have gone down the rabbit hole over. Did you know Pippin wasn't considered an adult Hobbit until this movie? He was about the equivalent of a sixteen year old human for the first two movies up to midway through Return of the King. It certainly explains some of his behavior.<p>


<h3>Transformers</h3><p>

I've been a fan of the franchise since Transformers: Armada when it was on Cartoon Network when I was a small child. It was fun to see the bots that I knew fairly well up on the big screen and not in cartoon form.<p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3><p>
 
Now, I do not condone any of Rowling's comments lately, especially as someone who is a part of the LGBT community, but I cannot deny that this was my favorite book and movie out of the seven. It introduced my favorite character, Remus Lupin, and truly showed that things were getting darker for all.
